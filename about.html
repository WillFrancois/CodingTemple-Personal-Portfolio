      <p>Hello! My name is William Francois. I am currently employeed as a Help Desk Technician and I am currently looking for positions as a software developer.
      I have previous experience programming for GreeningDetroit.com as a Webmaster's Assistant and have been programming since 2017 as a hobby.
      Some of my other hobbies include reverse engineering video games, cooking, and - of course - programming.
      I have completed courses such as the Web Applications for Everyone Specialization provided by the University of Michigan and the Google IT Specialization Certificate.
      I am currently enrolled in Coding Temple's Software Engineering course with an undecided specialization.</p>
