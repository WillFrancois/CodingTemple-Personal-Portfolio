      <article>
        <p>This project is a drawing app created using Vue.JS and Typescript. The application allows the user to draw a picture and export the drawing as an SVG file.
        SVG files able to be scaled infinitely without a loss of resolution, since they are defined using a series of mathematical expressions.
        After drawing and exporting, the user can import the exported file into Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, or GIMP.</p>

      <article>
        <p>This project uses the A-Star pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path to the solution of an 8-puzzle.
        An 8 puzzle is also known known as the sliding block puzzle and can be solved using a variety of strategies.
        However, A-star will always find the shortest amount of moves to solve and can also be applied to find the shortest path between two points.</p>

      <article>
        <p>This project uses bit manipulation and bit masking algorithms to determine what the largest possible number you can make in the Numbers game in Countdown is.
        Countdown is a British T.V. game show in which players are given 6 number and try to create a target number using addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction.
        This project has also been dockerized and can run in a container so the user will not need to install Rust locally to run it.</p>

      <article>
        <p>This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code 2023. 
        Advent of Code is an annual programming event that provides practical problems to be solved using programming algorithms.
        I chose to do that year's event in Python, though I also attempted Advent of Code in 2022 using Rust, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/WillFrancois/AOC_2022">here</a>.</p>
